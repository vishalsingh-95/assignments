For numerical features, we can replace missing values with the mean, median, or a custom value based on the distribution of the non-missing values.

    "# Model-Based Imputation:\n",
    "Train a separate predictive model for each feature with missing values, using the other features as predictors. Then, use these models to predict missing values.\n",

    "# Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance are both distance metrics used in the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between data points. The main difference lies in how they calculate distances in different directions within the feature space. Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two points, considering all dimensions. It calculates the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding feature values. On the other hand, Manhattan distance, also known as the L1 distance or city block distance, calculates the distance by summing the absolute differences between feature values along each dimension. While Euclidean distance reflects the \"as-the-crow-flies\" distance, Manhattan distance accounts for distance traveled along the grid-like city blocks. As a result, Euclidean distance tends to be sensitive to variations in all dimensions, favoring diagonal relationships, while Manhattan distance tends to emphasize differences along individual dimensions. The choice between these metrics depends on the nature of the data and the problem we're addressing with KNN."
