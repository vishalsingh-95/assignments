Here's how the optimization problem in PCA works and what it is trying to achieve:\n",

    "# Objective of PCA:\n",
    "PCA seeks to find a set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) linear combinations of the original features (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in the data. These principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they capture, with the first component capturing the most variance, the second capturing the second-most, and so on.\n",

    "# Optimization Problem:\n",
    "The optimization problem in PCA can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset X consisting of n data points, each with d features (dimensions), PCA aims to find a transformation matrix W such that when X is multiplied by W, it results in a new dataset Z of reduced dimensionality (typically much lower than d dimensions).

The covariance matrix of the original data is computed, and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are obtained. The eigenvectors correspond to the principal components, and the eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance captured by each component.\n",

    "# 1) Feature Ranking:\n",
    "In PCA, each principal component is a linear combination of the original features. The coefficients of this combination can be interpreted as the importance of each feature in defining that component. By analyzing these coefficients, we can rank the features based on their influence on the principal components. Features with higher coefficients are considered more important in explaining the variance in the data.\n",
