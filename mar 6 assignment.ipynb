    "# Common measures of central tendency used in statistics include the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1) Mean:\n",
    "The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of observations. It represents the arithmetic average of the data. The mean is sensitive to extreme values, as it takes into account all the values in the dataset. It is commonly used when the data is normally distributed or symmetrical.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Median:\n",
    "The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset, separating the higher half from the lower half. If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is robust to extreme values, making it suitable for skewed or non-normal distributions. It represents the value that divides the dataset into two equal parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) Mode: \n",
    "The mode represents the most frequently occurring value or values in a dataset. It is useful for categorical or discrete data, as it provides insight into the most common category or value. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Measures of variability describe the spread or dispersion of the data. Common measures of variability include the range, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1) Range:\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of variability and is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Variance:\n",
    "The variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It calculates the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Variance provides a more comprehensive measure of dispersion, taking into account the entire dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) Standard Deviation: \n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average deviation from the mean in the original units of the data. Standard deviation provides a widely used and easily interpretable measure of dispersion. It is particularly useful when comparing variability across different datasets or when assessing the spread of data around the mean."
