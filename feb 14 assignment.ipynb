    "# Advantages of multi threading are as follows:\n",
    "1) Improved Performance: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of multiple threads, enabling the program to utilize multiple CPU cores efficiently. This can lead to improved performance and faster execution times, especially when dealing with tasks that can be executed in parallel.\n",
    "2) Responsiveness and Enhanced User Experience: Multithreading helps in maintaining program responsiveness by keeping the user interface responsive while performing lengthy operations in the background. It prevents the program from becoming unresponsive or \"freezing\" during resource-intensive tasks.\n",
    "3) Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process can share data and resources more easily compared to multiple processes. This enables efficient communication and sharing of information between threads, reducing the need for complex inter-process communication mechanisms.\n",
    "4) Concurrency and Asynchronous Operations: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of different tasks or operations within a program. It facilitates the implementation of asynchronous operations, where multiple tasks can proceed independently, enhancing overall program efficiency and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantage of multithreading are as follows:\n",
    "1) Complexity and Difficulty of Debugging: Multithreaded programs can be more complex to design, implement, and debug compared to single-threaded programs. Issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization errors can arise, making it challenging to identify and fix such problems.\n",
    "2) Potential for Deadlocks and Synchronization Issues: If not handled properly, multithreaded programs can suffer from deadlocks, where threads become stuck waiting for each other, resulting in program halts. Managing synchronization and avoiding deadlocks require careful consideration and design.\n",
    "3) Increased Memory Overhead: Each thread in a program requires additional memory for its stack and other thread-specific data structures. Creating too many threads or using excessively large stacks can lead to increased memory usage and potentially impact overall performance."

    "Deadlock:\n",
    "Deadlock refers to a situation in concurrent programming where two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource or take some action. It occurs when there is a circular dependency between multiple threads or processes, and none of them can make progress. Deadlocks can lead to programs becoming unresponsive or freezing indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Race condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the interleaving or timing of multiple threads' execution. It arises when two or more threads access shared resources concurrently, and the final outcome of the program depends on the particular order in which the threads execute. The result of a race condition is typically inconsistent or incorrect data.\n",
    "For example if Thread X and Thread Y, both attempt to update a shared variable. If the threads execute concurrently without proper synchronization mechanisms in place, the final value of the shared variable can be unpredictable. The outcome depends on the relative timing and interleaving of the threads' execution, which will lead to a race condition. The result may vary each time the program runs, causing incorrect calculations, data corruption, or unexpected program behavior."
