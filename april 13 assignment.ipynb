    "# Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through two main mechanisms: bootstrapping and feature randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bootstrapping (Data Sampling): \n",
    "Random Forest Regressor employs bootstrapping, a process in which multiple decision trees are trained on different bootstrap samples of the training data. Bootstrapping involves randomly sampling the training data with replacement, creating subsets of data that may contain duplicate instances and omitting some instances. This process introduces diversity in the training data for each decision tree, leading to variations in the individual tree structures. As a result, the ensemble of decision trees learns from different perspectives of the data, making it less likely to memorize noise or specific patterns present in the training data. The averaging of predictions from multiple trees helps reduce the impact of outliers and noisy data points, leading to a more robust and generalized model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Randomness: \n",
    "In addition to bootstrapping, Random Forest Regressor further reduces overfitting by introducing feature randomness. During the training of each decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered at each split point. By randomly selecting features, the model avoids relying heavily on specific features that may be noisy or irrelevant for the regression task. This feature randomness encourages the ensemble to explore different feature combinations, preventing individual trees from becoming too specialized to the training data. As a result, the ensemble is less likely to overfit to the training data and more capable of generalizing to unseen data."

Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that builds a collection of multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to make the final regression prediction. By averaging predictions, it reduces variance and improves generalization, making it less prone to overfitting. In contrast, Decision Tree Regressor is a single model that directly predicts the target value by traversing a single decision tree. While Decision Tree Regressor may be more interpretable, it can suffer from overfitting and higher variance, as it lacks the averaging mechanism of the ensemble. The choice between the two algorithms depends on factors like interpretability needs, data complexity, and the tradeoff between model simplicity and performance."
